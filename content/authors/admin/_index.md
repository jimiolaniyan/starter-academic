I am a Master's student of computer science at the University of Grenoble Alpes. My research interest is the broad area of artificial intelligence and in particular, problems at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision and robotics. I am currently working with Prof. [Olivier Aycard](https://lig-membres.imag.fr/aycard/) as a summer intern where we are using deep learning methods to detect and track moving objects using only 2D laser data. Previously, I did my first-year Master's internship under the supervision of Prof. [Thomas Ropars](https://tropars.github.io/). My research focus was to detect performance issues in distributed systems using one-class classification techniques. 

In addition to my studies, I consult part-time for BAO Systems on a number of software development projects.
