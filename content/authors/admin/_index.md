I am a Master's student of computer science at the [University of Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) and [Grenoble INP](https://www.grenoble-inp.fr/). My research interest is the broad area of artificial intelligence and in particular, problems at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision and robotics. I am currently working with Prof. [Olivier Aycard](https://lig-membres.imag.fr/aycard/) as a summer intern where we are using deep learning methods to detect and track moving objects using only 2D laser data. Previously, I did my first-year Master's internship under the supervision of Prof. [Thomas Ropars](https://tropars.github.io/). My research focus was to detect performance issues in distributed systems using one-class classification techniques. 

In addition to my studies, I consult part-time for [BAO Systems](https://baosystems.com/) on a number of software development projects.
